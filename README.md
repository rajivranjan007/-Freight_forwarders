# -Freight_forwarders
The objective of the project was to develop an AI/ML script to help exporters get better rates and deals on their freight.
The script identifies freight forwarders that service a particular trade route,
provides an estimate of the best price quote by the freight forwarders, 
and calculates an approximate cost of freight based on user input parameters such as weight, quantity, and freight charges.
Additionally, the script lists freight forwarders who service the trade route and delivers the best service and price.
The data-model and information pipeline developed in this project are not limited to Botswana but can be applied globally to identify the best freight-forwarders for any trade route.
